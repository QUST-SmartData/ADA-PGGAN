Amounts of digital rock samples are crucial for studying pore properties. However, it is currently challenging due to equipment limitations or cost considerations. To address this issue, we propose sorts of reconstruction solutions under Data-Scarce Scenarios based on latent inversion predict from proposed generative model. Firstly, A novel featured distribution learning model was proposed  though O-ResNet50 network training for prepared inversion. During inversion, the    latent vectors predict from mentioned learning model is prepared to interpolate into latent space of given images. To stably produce high-quality images, Adaptive Data Augmentation Progressive Growing Generative Adversarial Network (ADA-PGGAN) is proposed, which includes a mechanism to supervise discriminator's overfitting and automatically adjust levels of data augmentation. Subsequently, interpolated latent vectors are input into the generator to progressively increase image resolution and reconstruct large-scale 3D digital rocks.Finally, evaluations using various metrics were conducted in both 2D and 3D on our results. The Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) was used to assess our proposed data augmentation operation. The majority of SWD values remained below 0.01, with further decreases as resolution increased. Furthermore, generated images accurately exhibited core characteristics.We also evaluated our results in 3D with corresponding metrics, structural properties to indicate consistency with given samples.

## Usage

### Requirements

This project requires:

```plain
pytorch
torchvision
numpy
scipy
```

### Datasets & Pre-trained Models

For our datasets and pre-trained models, download them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZvqJMX_jq-wynKw7iV_whJBcAo2bXRuu?usp=drive_link) .


### ADA-PGGAN
We first trained a generation model of ADA-PGGAN, the dataset is `500` binary slices of `1024Ã—1024` size, saved to the folder `1024_slice_500`, training command:

```bash
python train.py PGAN -c config_celebaHQ.json --restart -n celebaHQ --np_vis
```

The pre-trained ADA-PGGAN model is saved as `network-snapshot-000600.pkl` and can be called directly.


### RVION

(1) Use ADA-PGGAN model to generate 50K data set and save its corresponding input noise as a label, and store it in folder `gen_train50k` as a training set of Resnet50.

(2) The training command line of Resnet50 model: `python train.py`, and the pre-trained model is saved as `image_to_latent_ada.pt`.

(3) Inversion of the specified image using `encode_image.py`, command line:

```bash
python encode_image.py
test.png
dlatents.npy
--use_latent_finder true # Activates model.
--image_to_latent_path ./image_to_latent_ada.pt # Specifies path to model.
```

### Interpolation

Interpolate the potential vector obtained by RVION:

```bash
python interpolation.py
```
